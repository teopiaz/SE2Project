The PowerEnjoy Service needs to store information about:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User:} This data consist in a small set of user information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Car:} This data consist in a small set of car information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Safe Area:} This data consist in a small set of safe area information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Trip:} This data consist in a small set of trip information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GPS positioning:} This data consist on information received by user or by OnBoard device of the car. Because of the managing involve some algorithms it's considered \textbf{High}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{External Input} % (fold)
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Sign-Up:} Create a new user in the system. The complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Log-In/Log-Out:} Manage the user authentication. The complexity has been considered \textbf{Medium}
	\item \textbf{Update user information:} Update users information in the system. The complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Request car reservation:} Manage the car reservation in the system. The complexity has been considered \textbf{Medium}
	\item \textbf{Unlock car:} Check if the user is nearby the reserved car and send an unlock request to the car. The complexity has been considered \textbf{Complex}
