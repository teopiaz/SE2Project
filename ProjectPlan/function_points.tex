The PowerEnjoy Service needs to store information about:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User:} This data consist in a small set of user information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Car:} This data consist in a small set of car information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Safe Area:} This data consist in a small set of safe area information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
	\item \textbf{Trip:} This data consist in a small set of trip information, for this reason its complexity has been considered \textbf{Simple}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GPS positioning:} This data consist on information received by user or by OnBoard device of the car. Because of the managing involve some algorithms it's considered \textbf{Medium}
