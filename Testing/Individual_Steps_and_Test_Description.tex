{Reservation correctly created}
{Mock of some user and reservation data }
{Test that verify that the reservation is created for an existing user and error handling for incorrect data }

\teststep 
{Reservation Manager -> DMBS}
{Create a method call that delete a reservation  }
{Reservation correctly marked as deleted}
{Mock of some reservation data }
{Test that verify that the reservation is marked as deleted but still present in the DB and error handling for incorrect data }



\teststep 
{Service Manager -> Fee Manager -> Payment System <<stub>>}
{Create a method call that calculate a fee for a reservation and call the Payment System }
{Payment accepted}
{Mock of some reservation data, pre-calculated fare and a stub for the Payment System }
{Test check that the fare are correctly calculated and the payment system receive the payment request}

\teststep 
{ Position Manager -> GPS}
{Create a method call that update the GPS position for a list of cars }
{Cars position correctly update}
{Mock of some cars object  }
{Test check if the Position Manager handle correctly the various format of GPS coordinate}


\teststep 
{ Service Manager -> Position Manager -> GPS}
{Create a method call that return a list of cars inside a given radius list }
{The returned list are the same of the cars mock lists per radius}
{Mock of some cars object and a list of radius  }
{Test check if the Position Manager handle correctly the request}

\teststep 
{ Service Manager -> Car Manager }
{Create a method call that request information about a car }
{Returned information are correct}
{Mock of a car object}
{Test check if the Car Manager correctly handle request for car information}

{ Service Manager -> Car Manager }
{Create a method call that update information about a car }
{Car information are correctly updated}
{Mock of a car object}
{Test check if the Car Manager correctly handle update for car information}

\teststep 
{ Request Handler -> Service Manager }
{Create different method calls for all the possible valid requests and an invalid request }
{Service Manager handle correctly all the requests and return an error for invalid request}
{mock data for all the valid request}
{Test check if the service manager handle all the valid requests}

\teststep 
{OnBoard Device -> Service Manager }
{Phisically or virtually send data from the OnBoard Device to the Service Manager }
{Service Manager accept the connection }
{OnBoard Device or an OnBoard device simulator}
{The test check the connection between the OnBoard Device and the System}


\teststep 
{ HTTP Server -> Request Handler }
{All the possible CRUD REST Requests sent to the HTTP Server }
{Request Handler correctly parse all the request and return a valid response for all request}
{Mock of all the CRUD Requests and some bad formatted HTTP requests}
