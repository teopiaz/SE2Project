\section{INTEGRATION STRATEGY}
\subsection{Entry Criteria} Specify the criteria that must be met before integration testing of specific elements may begin (e.g., functions must have been unit tested)
\subsection{Elements to be Integrated} Identify the components to be integrated, refer to the design document to identify such components in a way that is consistent with your design
\subsection{Integration Testing Strategy} Describe the integration testing approach (top-down, bottom-up, functional groupings, etc.) and the rationale for the choice of that approach.
\subsection{Sequence of Component/Function Integration} 
\subsubsection{Software Integration Sequence} For each subsystem, identify the sequence in which the software components will be integrated within the subsystem; relate this sequence to any product features that are being built up
\subsubsection{Subsystem Integration Sequence} Identify the order in which subsystems will be integrated;  if you have a single subsystem, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 have to be merged in a single section
