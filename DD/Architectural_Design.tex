\section{ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN}
\subsection{Overview} 
In this section is provided a complete overview of all the system components, from the logical level to the physical level of the PowerEnJoy service. First of all we give a description of the high level components and their interaction.\newline

\noindent From an high level prospective the service is composed by different modules allowing development and maintenance flexibility.This modularity allow also scalability for future service expansion, \todo{espandere il concetto} \newline

\noindent The main components of the system are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Database:}} the data layer of the service. All the persistent data will be stored in this layer.
\item{\textbf{Application Server:}} this component will manage the applicative logic.
\item{\textbf{Web Server:}} this layer is the interface with the world. It will manage the requests from the users and the website.
\item{\textbf{Mobile Application:}} this component will be a simple view that generate request and show data. \todo{espandere xD, oggi zero fantasia}
\item{\textbf{Car OnBoard Device:}} this is the module mounted on the car. It will communicate with the server and with the car ECU.
\end{itemize}
