\section{ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN}
\subsection{Overview} 
In this section is provided a complete overview of all the system components, from the logical level to the physical level of the PowerEnJoy service. First of all we give a description of the high level components and their interaction.\newline

\noindent From an high level prospective the service is composed by different modules allowing development and maintenance flexibility.This modularity allow also scalability for future service expansion, \todo{espandere il concetto} \newline


\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Database:}} the data layer of the service. All the persistent data will be stored in this layer.
\item{\textbf{Application Server:}} this component will manage the Business logic.
\item{\textbf{HTTP Server:}} this layer is the interface with the world. It will manage the requests from the users and the website.
\item{\textbf{Mobile Application Interface:}} this is the interface between the Mobile User and the system. The user will use it to send requests to the web Server and see the results sent back through his mobile device. 
\item{\textbf{Car OnBoard Device:}} this is the module mounted on the car. It will communicate with the server and with the car ECU.
\item{\textbf{Web Site Interface:}} this is the interface between the Web User and the system.The user will use it to send requests to the Web Server to get static contents and send requests to the Application Server to use the service.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component view} 
From a lower level perspective, the components of the system can be divided in 2 subsystems: the Frontend system and the Backend system
\todo{Tutto ok, però qui c'è sia component che deployment. Bisogna splittare le due cose}

\subsubsection{Frontend}
In the Frontend there are all those components that will work as interfaces between the user and system and will allow the user to use the functions of the service. So the Frontend is made by three GUIs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Web Client GUI: It is the graphic interface used by the user that access the service through the Website
\item Mobile Client GUI: It is the graphic interface used by the user that access the service through the Mobile Application.
\item Driver Client GUI: It is the graphic interface used by the user when he interact with the system using the OnBoard Device.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Backend}
In the Backend there all those component that aren't used directly by the user, but they perform operations that allow to satisfy the requests of the users. The components of the Backend are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data Manager: This component is the one that can access the database. It has the function of inserting, deleting and updating data in the database, when asked by other components. Furthermore, it provides to other components the data needed for their operations.
\item Request Manager: This component is the one that has the function of managing the requests for reservations coming from the clients.
\item Account Manager: This component is responsible of managing all the operations concerning the accounts, such as registration, login and logout, modification of personal data.
\item Position Manager: This component has the task of managing the position of the cars provided by the GPS and provide it to the other components that need it. 
\item Travel Manager: This component is responsible of managing all the information about the travel, such as the current current position of the car, the safe areas and the special parking area. It has to communicate all this information to the Driver Client GUI.
\item Fee Manager: This component is responsible for the calculation and the application of discounts on the fee of the travels has the task of charging the user. For these reason it is interfaced with an external payment system. \todo{Forse dobbiamo decidere un sistema di pagamento}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment view}


The communication between the clients (both mobile application and web site) are realized using a request-response methodology. The client ask for information or make action related to the server using \textbf{REST} requests and obtain a response from the server formatted as a \textbf{JSON} object, today the state of the art for web services communications.
All the REST requests received by the \textbf{HTTP Server} are processed by the Request Handler component. The Request Handler component is in charge of validate the request integrity, parse it using the \textbf{REST Parser }component and check the authentication for the requests type that need a valid session.



When a requests pass those check is forwarded to the Service Manager where the application logic is applied.
The \textbf{Service Manager} in base of what request are received process a response using Car Manager, User Manager, Position Manager and Trip Manager.
Using those component the Service Manager can access the model, manage the request and craft a response.Every request can instantiate different component,


The system status are represented through various \textbf{Java Beans} object that stay alive for all the time needed for the request processing.


When a request is received all the element from the model needed for the processing are loaded from the persistent data storage through the \textbf{Persistent Data interface}. The abstraction exposed by the Persistent Data interface allow to adopt different data storage solution in a transparent way to the various component that are using it. All the persistent data are stored through a distributed database that can optimize data access.

The \textbf{Position Manager} implements the logic for the manage of the position and the distance between cars, users and safe area. It also handle which cars show to the user in base of the a chosen radius. \ref{algoritmo_posizione}

The \textbf{Car Manager} manage the car status and if a request is legit send a request to the specific On Board device to unlock the car.

\subsubsection{REST}
As explained in the introduction the communication takes place via REST requests. The REST model establish a relation map between the common CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete of a resource) and the HTTP operations as explained in the following table.

			Read & GET & GET /cars/zone/12 & Retrieve information. \\  Requests must be safe and idempotent.\tabularnewline
			\hline 
			Update & PUT & PUT /user/gpsposition & Update an existing entity. Request is idempotent. \tabularnewline
			\hline 
			Delete & DELETE & DELETE /car/request/28 & Remove a resource.\tabularnewline
			\hline 
		\end{tabular}
	\end{adjustbox}	
	\captionof{table}{Rest/CRUD interface mapping.}

\subsubsection{Database Connectivity} \textbf{JDBC} (Java Database Connectivity) is used as connector between Database and the Application Server. JDBC, in fact, is a software component that allows Java applications to interact with databases. It has been chosen because have support for almost every \textbf{DBMS} on the market.
To enhance the connection, JDBC requires drivers for each database. These drivers connect to the database and implement the protocol to query and get respective results between the client and database. 


\textbf{ODBC} driver is a level of abstraction that allows programmers to make SQL requests to access data from distinct Database without having to know the proprietary interfaces of each DB. In this way it is easier to change the database without altering the application layer.


The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.



\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns}
Please explain which styles/ pattern you used, why, and how
\subsubsection{Architecture}

We realized a 4-tiered architecture. In particular, the data layer, the presentation layer, the web server and the application server will have their own dedicated machine. The reasons why we made this choice concern:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\textbf{Security:}} Is possible to setup a DMZ for the webserver and filter malicious requests before they reach the application server.
\item {\textbf{Scalability:}} Because of the separation of the layers, developers can modify existing functions or introduce new ones in any level (presentation, logic or data), leaving the other layers untouched.
\item {\textbf{Performance:} The webserver do a massive use of cache and load balancer to serve only static content to minimize resource and traffic}
\item {\textbf{Reliability:}} \todo{se introduciamo ridondanza con più di un server, possiamo dire che aumentano reliability}
\item {\textbf{Availability:}}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Patterns}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\textbf{Client-Server:}} According to this pattern, in the system there should be 2 entities: a Client, that sends requests, and a Server, that elaborates requests and sends back results to the client. In our architecture there 3 Clients: the Mobile Client, the Web Client and the Driver Client. These all three  clients send requests to the \st{Web Server}HTTP server on the Application server, that takes care of forward it to the Request Handler and send back and show to the clients the results.


\item{\textbf{Model-View-Controller:}} In the MVC pattern there are 3 entities: The Model, that contains methods to access the data, the View, that shows data to the user and allow him to perform actions, and the Controller, that elaborates the commands sended by the view manipulating and modifying  the data of the model.
In our system the View is the Client, the Model is the Data Manager and the Controller is the Service Manager. Furthermore, between the View and the Controller we have put 2 middle components, to improve the quality and the performance of the system. The Web Server act as a request receiver and sends the commands of the View to the Request Handler. The Request Handler act as validator and activates the forwarding of the command to the Controller only if the request respects integrity and authentication constraints.

\item{\textbf{Dependency Injection:}} Because of the amount of users  

\end{itemize}
