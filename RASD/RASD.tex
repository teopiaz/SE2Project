\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Purpose}
\todo{forse sbagliato, nelle slide c'è scritto di mettere qui i goals}

This document is the RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document). The goal of this document is to describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the system in order to show the constraints on the software that the developer has to take into account. This document can have a legal value and can be used as a contractual basis between the customers and the developers.

\subsection{Scope}
The system the has to be developed is called \emph{PowerEnJoy}. It is a digital system for the management of a car-sharing service that only employs electric cars. In particular the aim is to develop a mobile application that allows the user to pick up and use electric cars in the areas reached by the service. 

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}


\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User: is a general person who uses ``PowerEnJoy''.
	\item Registered User: a user that have completed the registration process.
	\item Guest: a visitor, not authenticated user.
	\item Driver: authenticated user that drive the requested car.
	\item Car reservation: allocation of a car for a definited amount of time.
	\item Safe area: \todo{Specificare}
	\item Car-Sharing Area: area in which users can find and park a car of the car-sharing service.
	
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document Overview}
The structure of this document follows the IEEE standard for the editing of a RASD document. In particular the structure is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction: it provides a general description of the document and the system that has to be developed
	\item Overall Description: it provides a general description of all the things that  affects the work on the project and the elaboration of the requirements. So it gives information about hardware and software choices and availability, the main functions of the product, the description of the people at whom the product is addressed, the constraints that will limit the work of the developer, the assumptions done before the development and the dependencies that the use of the product will have from hardware and software entities
	\item Specific Requirements: it provides a detailed description of the requirements of the product
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Given Problem}

\subsection{Proposed System}


\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Citizens
	\item Electric cars companies
	\item Electricity providers
	
	
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Actors}
\todo[inline]{aggiungiamo la macchina e le safe area?}
The entities identified in the problem description are the following: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item GUEST: is a visitor, someone that isn't signed-up yet. He can visualize
	``PowerEnJoy'' Web site and download the mobile app but he cannot
	access to any service.
	\item USER: is a client signed-up, via Web or mobile app. He accesses
	``Passenger Area'' and, after successfully logged in, he can see
	his personal section, modify his personal information. He can also
	access to all services,view a map of available cars, make car reservations, modify or
	cancel them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Goals}
\todo{In teoria la lista dei goal deve essere presente}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {[}G1{]} Allow guests to register to ``PowerEnJoy'' service through
	both website or mobile application.
	\item {[}G2{]} Allow registered users to login and logout.
	\item {[}G3{]} Allow authenticated users to modify their personal details
	and payment informations.
	\item {[}G4{]} Allow authenticated users to view a list of available car
	in a configurable radius of distance from user position or specified
	address.
	\item {[}G5{]} Allow authenticated users to request for pick up an available
	car for a limited time and unlock it when the User is in proximity.
	\item {[}G6{]} Allow authenticated users to drive the unlocked car inside
	the border of the city.
	\item {[}G7{]} Allow driver to be constantly informed about the service through a screen on the car.
	\item {[}G8{]} Allow driver to get discount in base of pick up/parking
	position of the ar, number of passengers and status of the battery.
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Description}



\subsection{Product perspective}\todo[inline]{(further details on the shared phenomena and a domain model{-->}class diagrams and statecharts)}
The system that we are going to develop is a Mobile Application, so an application usable from every Tablet or Smartphone that has access to an internet connection. The application will be available on Android and iOS. There also will be a website where a user can find information about the service.


\subsection{User characteristics}
Everyone who has a car license will be able to register to the car-sharing service and drive one of the electric car available.
Because of the variety of people that will use the service, the mobile application must be simple and user-friendly, so that anyone can use it even if it has a little knowledge about the use of a mobile device.

\subsection{Constraints}



\subsection{Assumptions}
\todo{Da completare!}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Every car can be uniquely recognized by his plate number.
	\item The position of the users are well-known thanks to GPS.
	\item The user is the one and only who drives the cars he reserves.
	\item Any user who reserves a car has enough money on his credit card to pay the travel.
	\item Every car is periodically checked to ensure proper operation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Regulatory policies}
It’s user responsibility to ensure that the use of the system complies with the local laws and policies. If the user register to the service must allow for the permission to acquire, store and process personal data and web cookies. The system must offer to the user the possibility to delete the account and all the personal data.


\subsubsection{Possible Future Implementations}
Depending on the success that the developed system will have, it will be possible to extend the car-sharing to Scooters and Mini-Cars, in order to reach also younger customers.
\\ \noindent 
Another possibility for the future is to allow users to get in touch with strangers and pick them up in the middle of the travel.
